This is an anonymous chat website where users can send secret messages without revealing their identity, inspired by platforms like NGL. The project is built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and **AJAX**, with a responsive design for mobile devices. The website allows users to send messages on one page and read the messages on another, all in real-time without refreshing the page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **XAMPP** (or any local server with PHP and MySQL)
- Basic knowledge of PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS

### Installation and Setup

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### 1. Install XAMPP

- Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) if you don't have it installed.
- Start **Apache** and **MySQL** services from the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SM76020/anonymous_chat.git
```

Move the cloned project folder to your XAMPP's `htdocs` directory, typically located at:
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\
```

### 3. Create the Database

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
2. Create a new database called `anonymous_chat`.
3. Import the provided `anonymous_chat.sql` file into the database:
   - Click on the **Import** tab in phpMyAdmin.
   - Select the `anonymous_chat.sql` file from the project folder.
   - Click **Go** to import the table and data.

### 4. Update Database Configuration (If Needed)

If you are using different database credentials, update the `index.php` and `messages.php` files with your database username and password in the following sections:

```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";  // Default for XAMPP
$password = "";      // Default for XAMPP
$dbname = "anonymous_chat";
```

### 5. Run the Application

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/anonymous-chat/` to access the project.
2. You will see two pages:
   - `index.php` for **sending messages**.
   - `messages.php` for **reading messages** in real-time.

### 6. Project Structure

- **index.php**: The page where users can send anonymous messages.
- **messages.php**: The page where messages are displayed in real-time.
